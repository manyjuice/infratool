# 🚀 Infratool: Open Infrastructure as Code Library

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/manyjuice/infratool/pulls)

> Community-driven IaC templates to deploy and manage software **faster, smarter, easier** across servers and containers.

## 🌟 Why Infratool Exists

Tired of:
- Writing the same Ansible playbooks/Terraform modules for every project?
- Hunting for production-ready K8s configurations?
- Wasting time on repeating administration operations instead of solving real problems?

This repo solves that - collaborative IaC templates you can use in the production.
